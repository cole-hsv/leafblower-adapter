An adapter for a leafblower to connect a drainpipe and to a nozzel.

## Running

[Live Version](http://openjscad.org/#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cole-hsv/leafblower-adapter/master/dist/leafblower.jscad)

The jscad project `leafblower` uses gulp to create a `dist/leafblower.jscad` file and watches your source for changes. You can drag the `dist/leafblower.jscad` directory into the drop area on [openjscad.org](http://openjscad.org). Make sure you check `Auto Reload` and any time you save, gulp will recreate the `dist/leafblower.jscad` file and your model should refresh.

## jscad-utils

The example project uses [jscad-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jscad-utils). This is a set of utilities that make object creation and alignment easier.
